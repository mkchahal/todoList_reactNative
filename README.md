## Installation

### System setup
1. Clone the repo with `git clone git@github.com:mkchahal/todoList_reactNative.git` command
2. Switch to the project's root directory in terminal
3. Install the dependencies by running `npm install`
4. Once, 'npm install' is completed, run `expo start` to start the expo
5. If it shows a QR code on the terminal as a result of 'exp start' command, then you are good to go!

Ignore the first step on 'Mobile setup' instructions given below if you already have 'Expo' app installed on your phone.

#### Mobile setup
1. Install 'Expo' application on your android/iOS device. You can find the links to Android and iOS apps [here](https://expo.io/tools#client).
2. Scan the QR code shown on the terminal.
3. Once the QR code is successfully scanned, it will take few seconds to load and render the app.

#### Run on IOS or Andriod Simulators

`npm run ios`

OR

`npm run android`
